# fOptimize

## Description
Fortran modules that provides simple Continuous Optimization methods. The main purpose is solve generic continuous functions
given by a Fortran function environment.

The routines has only academic purpose. Further applications will need improvements, of course.

## Features

* One-dimensional optimization methods:
  + Bissection
  + Golden Ratio
  + Newton
  + Secant
  
* Multidimensional unconstrained optimization methods:
  + Gradient (Cauchy)
  + Newton
  + Self-scaling Davidon--Fletcher--Powell (DFP)
  + Self-scaling Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno (BFGS)
  + Self-scaling Broyden family (DFP+BFGS)
  
One can find futher information about the above methods in Classical Optimization books like Luenberger, Nocedal, Bazaraa
and so on.
